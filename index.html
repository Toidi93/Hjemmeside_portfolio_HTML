      Prior to my studies at Geoscience I studied Chemistry for two years, and
      it was here I found my interest in water â€“ which prompted the change from
      Chemistry to Geoscience. My completed courses reflect this interest in
      water, as I have chosen courses that have given me experience in how to
      use GIS for mapping, MODFLOW for groundwater molding and PhreeqC to do
      calculations of water samples. I highly enjoy working in the field and
      solve problems. I am certain my analytic approach will be very helpful in
      solving any type of water related issues as they are presented during the
      course. Furthermore, I enjoy working in groups as I find that
      well-functioning teams often end up with a better solution to any given
      problem. I can contribute with my knowledge from my completed courses, but
      also the state-of-the-art knowledge from my master thesis.
